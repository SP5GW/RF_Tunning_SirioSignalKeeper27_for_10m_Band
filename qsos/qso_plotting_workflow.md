# Workflow of plotting QSOs on the map by Adam, SQ5VCO (YT:@AdamSQ5VCO).

1. Go to:
https://www.rickmurphy.net/lotwquery.htm 
created by Richard, K1MU and generate *.adi qsl report, which will serve as a base for the map (in my case I limited qsl dates to the time of 2025 cq ww contest). 
2. Use log analyzer:
https://qsomap.cqgma.org/ADIF_to_Karte.php
prepared by Mario, DL4MFM and graph the map.

I did not use log analyzer's functionality to generate the graphics file, since in my case resulting image was distorted.
Instead I used snip tool in windows to screen capture desired portion of the map.
